            Hi! I am a 23 y/o Slovak guy, who likes to code. I am keen to learn
            new technologies. We gotta move forward, as fast as the IT world is.

          <p>
            In my early years before college I worked in several restaurants as
            a part-timer. There I learned how to be patient and how to talk to
            customers.

          <h6>Support Operator</h6>
          <p>
            In April 2016 I started working as a support operator in Millennium.
            There I learned MS Dynamics, MSSQL and broaden my knowledge of C#.
            During this period I have created a game called
            <a href="https://onemandevz.itch.io/gopniksimulator" target="_blank"
              ><span class="text-secondary">Gopnik Simulator</span></a
            >, which was the first game I have ever published.

          <h6>Support Developer</h6>
          <p>
            In March 2018 I wanted to extend my experience in the field and got
            promoted to Support Developer. That means that beside the support I
            actively participated on projects and helped the team on various
            projects, creating plugins for CRMs and developing custom CMS
            systems. During this period I also got interested in web app
            development. Thanks to my friend

            from Germany I learned basics of React, React Native, Docker. This
            led to learning the whole MERN stack alongside with Redux, GraphQL,
            Webpack and other technologies.

          <p>
            In July 2019 I became a full-stack developer for the Millennium. I
            started maintaining React apps in various projects. Currently I am
            creating an intern app for a international client.
